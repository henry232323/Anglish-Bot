COMMANDS:

/help      --> how to use

/m <word>  --> exact match in all languages
/am <word> --> exact match in Anglish
/em <word> --> exact match in English

/f <word>  --> soft match in all languages
/af <word> --> soft match in Anglish
/ef <word> --> soft match in English

Want to search the offerings page too?
Append an -o to the command string!
Ex: /emo <word> --> exact match in English in wordbook & offerings
    /afo <word> --> soft match in Anglish in wordbook & offerings



What is a "soft match"?
Unlike a "hard match" (exact), a soft match (/f) will return all results that contain the query.
Ex: /f brook --> upbrook, abrook, brook
    /f use   --> outler, offcome



Bot is typing...?
Be patient! Your query is still being processed.
Please wait and more entries will load.
